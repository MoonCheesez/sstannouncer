# SST Announcer: Never miss an announcement again
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joeltio/sstannouncer.svg?branch=kotlin)](https://travis-ci.org/joeltio/sstannouncer)

I'm sure we all had those painful moments,
it was all so subtle, so quiet, so easy to miss.
"Huh?" "What?" "When was this announcement was given?"
Then it hits you that you missed that critical announcement,
plans start to for apart, the panic sets in, you don't have control.
I know, because I have been there.
So we made a little tool, to make life a little less painful for everyone.
Never miss an announcement again.

Announcer for Android.
Inspired by the original Announcer for iOS, developed by Fourier Industries.
Made by Joel and Associates Inc, a subdivision of SST Inc.
